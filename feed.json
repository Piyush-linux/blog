Fish indeed is an overlooked shell that could be a great fit for beginners and advanced FOSSers alike.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Fish provides a range of features that makes it an attractive choice. From syntax highlight to abbreviation (my favorite), there are numerous novelties here.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Let me share some of my favorite Fish shell features with you.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"1-syntax-highlighting\">\n      1. Syntax highlighting\n    </h2>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>It is better to spot errors before they get executed. This saves a lot of time, energy and frustration.<br></li><li>Most modern code editors have the syntax highlighting built-in. Fish has this functionality built into the shell itself and it works on Linux commands.<br></li><li>Incorrect commands? You see it highlighted in red. The same goes for arguments and options that do not match with the context.<br></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    <br><br>\n  </p>",
